# Half-Life 2 Textures for Source 2 games

A resource for mod makers for S&box, Half-Life Alyx, and Steam VR with ported textures from Half-Life 2.
These are NOT for commercial use, please do not try to sell addons and maps with these textures. This is a warning!
I didn't make these assets! But I did spend the time to port them all. All rights go to Valve Software and their amazing game!

This is the _c build, go to https://github.com/Lunaside-Games/hl2textures-for-Source-2 for all files. (This will be updated less than main)
